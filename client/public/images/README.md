# Project Images Directory

## Image Guidelines

### File Requirements:
1. Image Size: 1200x800 pixels (recommended)
2. Format: JPG, PNG, or WebP
3. Max file size: 500KB (optimize images for web)

### Adding New Project Images:
1. Place your image file in this directory
2. Use a descriptive name (e.g., `neural-network-project.jpg`)
3. Update the image path in `src/lib/constants.ts`
4. Example path: `"/images/neural-network-project.jpg"`

### Tips for Good Project Images:
- Use high-contrast, clear images that showcase your project
- Ensure text is readable if screenshots contain text
- Consider using a consistent style across project images
- Compress images before adding them (use tools like TinyPNG)

### Example Project Types:
1. Screenshots of applications
2. Diagrams of system architecture
3. Photos of physical projects
4. UI/UX design mockups

Remember to keep backup copies of your original images before compression.
